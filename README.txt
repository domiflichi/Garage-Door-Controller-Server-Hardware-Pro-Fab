This repository contains the Eagle files you can use to manipulate the circuit board
or create gerber files to have your board made by a professional board house. 

This is the recommended repository to use to send off to a board house because it 
is a 2-sided board.


If you want to make your own board at home, I have a single-sided version at:

For more information and instructions on how to set all of this up and how everything works
together, please visit the home page of the project on my website:
